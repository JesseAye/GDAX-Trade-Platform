# GDAX Trade Platform
Unofficial desktop application for the GDAX cryptocurrency market. Currently non-operational given the buginess and inefficiency of the current code. Authentication will require you to create your own API Key.
Credit to https://github.com/dougdellolio/gdax-csharp for providing the library in use within this application. This is my first major(?) program I've worked on, and I'm learning a lot on the way. 

## Current features
1. Authentication

2. Execute Trades
	- Buy/Sell Market

	- Buy/Sell Stop
